# Cinch Http Server Plugin

This plugin provides a simple HTTP server inside Cinch, allowing him to interact
with external services. This plugin itself just starts/stops the HTTP server, so
you want to build your own Cinch plugins on top of it. Just extend your own
plugin with Cinch::HttpServer::Verbs and define your HTTP handlers!

Taken from https://github.com/Quintus/cinch-plugins with some small
modifications by myself to fit stylistically with the other plugins I use.
